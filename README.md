# Responsive Portfolio

For this project, the focus was utilizing the tools provided with **Bootsrap** to create a responsive site. While you can create a site only with an HTMl file and an external CSS document linked, learning to utilize a set of defined style opttions can help with uniformity.

Bootsrap has various components and elements that other developers can utilize by searching thorugh their directory. By linking our HTML page to this design style, it can be easier for other developers to understand the logic behind the styling without having to read another CSS file. 

Additionally, there are restrictions needed to be accounted for when developing a **mobile responsive** site. If the elements on the webpage are not suited for different viewport sizes, 

By using a navigation bar, I was able to link the three pages together for the user to be able to navigate seemlesly between the Home page, Portfolio page, and a Contact page. 

When working on the layout of the pages, it appeared that to create a uniform layout, the template for how the pages and containers are designed could be copied and pasted. After doing so, there only needed to be modifications with the content inside the containers to be suited for the information that would be inside.
